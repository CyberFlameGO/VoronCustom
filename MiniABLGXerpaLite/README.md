LGX Lite Mount (beta) for V0.1 MiniAfterSherpa - Replaces MiniSherpa

Use 2 x M3x8 from bottom up to secure LGX Lite to mount (Let me know if M3x10 would be better)
Use 2 x M3x12 from top down to secure mount to Mini-AfterSherpa https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa

*Note: Strain Relief is pending.  

Use PTFE tube (the include PTFE from LGX Lite is too short)
